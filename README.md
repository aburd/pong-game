This is just a small project to help me learn Typescript

This project assumes you have gulp installed globally.

1. Run 'git clone', then cd into that dir
2. Run 'npm install'
3. Run 'gulp typescript'
4. Run 'npm start'
5. Open browser to localhost:3000

## Controls

P1 is controlled with up and down arrow keys. That's it.
